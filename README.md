# BUILDING

To build the project use either the provided CodeBlocks project file (Targets are defined for Linux, Windows and Mac) or type

<pre>
make
</pre>

to build the project. Once it has finished without error an executable called cythar should have been created. Just run that with

<pre>
./cythar
</pre>

# NOTES

The code is not clean and very crazy -> I tried out and learned many things. But it's working :-).

A rewrite and the following version you will find here: https://github.com/monotomy/cythar-online


If you are interested to make some crazy things, any help is welcome.
